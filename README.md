## User Personas

## User Stories

The user stories outlined in my [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/hogbergmarkus/projects/14/views/1) is what drove my development of features.

I created epics with a following user story. Then created acceptance critera and tasks for each user story.

To implement agile methodology I utilized GitHub Projects, along with priority labels, and mapped them to a Milestone.

The user storys in my GitHub project are as follows:

- As a user I can easily navigate from the home page since it is not cluttered so that I can get to what I want fast.
- As a Site User I can create an account so that I can sign in.
- As a Site User I can make a booking with the resort so that I have a reservation.
- As a Site User I can go to my profile page so that I can see my bookings.
- As a Site User I can edit and delete my bookings so that I can adjust my bookings if I change my mind.
- As a Site Admin I can view contact requests from the contact form so that I can respond to the request.
- As a Site Admin I can create, read, update and delete user bookings so that I can manage the bookings.
- As a Site User I can view images and read about the resort so that I can decide if it is for me.
